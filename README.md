# ðŸŽž Analog

This project is a set of utilities helping me getting organized with scans.

Part of it might look like a rebuilt of a catalog. 
Goal is to not have to rely on lightroom all the time. 

## Current Commands

```
$ analog
Commands:
  analog catalog:build                                 # Build symlinks to rolls per camera and per film
  analog offline:build                                 # Create an offline HTML contact sheet per folder
  analog photos:rename                                 # Rename roll pictures based on information
  analog rolls:details [ROLL_NUMBER]                   # See Roll details
  analog rolls:overview [YEAR]                         # See all
  analog rolls:rename                                  # Rename roll based on information
  analog rolls:stats [YEAR]                            # See some stats
```

## Config

Create a `~/.analog` file with 

```
path: /path/to/scans 
```

Where `/path/to/scans` has the `cameras.yml` and `films.yml` and  a yearly structure

## Folders Structures

```
Photos/
Photos/raws/2021/20210101-... # This one goes developed in Lightroom or is already developed. 
Photos/scans/2021/20210101-...
Photos/scans/2021/20210101-.../index.md
ðŸ”— Cameras/Leica M6/2021/20210101-.../
ðŸ”— Films/Kodak - Portra 400/2021/20210101-...
```

## Frontmatter index files

```

Roll story

- Frontmatter format is YAML.
- Mandatory keys: 
	- camera
	- film
- Allowed keys:
	- lenses/lens if only one
	- themes
	- iso

Folder structure is built based on the information we have in the files here. 
Camera and Film might become slugs from 2 files

- cameras.yaml
- films.yaml

those would be lists of cameras slugs and information

If we are not using negativelabpro, we might also push exif information to the files in the format

### cameras.yaml

```
leica-m6:
  name: Leica M6
  lenses:
  - name: Summilux 35mm...
    slug: summilux-35
olympus-xa:
  name: Olympus XA
  lens: 35mm 2.8 # Fixed lense
```

### films.yaml

```
portra-400:
  name: Portra 400
  producer: Kodak
```

## Inpsiration

- Frontmatter and index.md files come from my use of Hugo/Jekyll. 
- Exif data comes from me wanting something organized without touching anything

## Ideas
- Tag folders with https://brettterpstra.com/2017/08/22/tagging-files-from-the-command-line/
